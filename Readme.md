# 3D Tank game using Babylon.js.

This is a class project which I did with my friend. 

+ We created a tank game where user can move from one stages to another (3 different stages).

+ We created enemies. They can shoot us back and we will die if they shoot us.

+ We created the shooting animation,how the shooting ammune is created and shoot to where.

+ We created the interaction as well such as when hitting with the ammune, what will happen?
